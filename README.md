## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amruth6002/Smart-Provider-Credentialing-Analytics-Platform.git
   cd Smart-Provider-Credentialing-Analytics-Platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The key AI dependencies are:
   - `sentence-transformers`: For semantic understanding
   - `transformers`: For text generation models
   - `torch`: Backend for model inference

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### First Run
When you first use AI features, the system will:
1. Download models automatically (one-time, ~100MB)
2. Cache models locally for future use
3. Fall back to rule-based processing if models aren't available

### Quick Demo with Sample Data
1. Start the application
2. Click "Load Sample Dataset" in the sidebar
3. Explore the interactive dashboard and charts
4. Try AI-powered queries like:
   - "How many providers have expired licenses?"
   - "Show me quality issues by specialty"
   - "What's our overall data quality score?"
   - "Show me phone formatting issues"

```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Intent Patterns
Add your own patterns in `src/intents.py` for domain-specific queries.

### Model Optimization
For production environments:
- Pre-download models during deployment
- Use model quantization for reduced memory usage
- Implement model warm-up for faster first responses
